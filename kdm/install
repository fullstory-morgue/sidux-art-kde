Sidux Debian1 Login Screen by Cathbard Druid.

To install this login screen, place this folder somewhere handy (as an example, 
create /home/username/themes and place it there)
Now edit /etc/kde3/kdm/kdmrc as root and edit the theme definition
to read:

UseTheme=True
Theme=/home/username/themes/sidux-debian1-kdm
(replace /home/username/themes/sidux-debian1-kdm with the folder you used)

Save it and logout.
